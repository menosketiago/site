                <h1>Salary and income</h1>

                <p>
                    I've talked about money with my colleagues, mentees, and friends for years. Knowing how much people get paid is one of the missing steps to fixing gender-based income inequality (you can also replace gender with race and country of origin).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Last week, <b>Dan Mall</b> blew my mind with his <a href="https://danmall.com/salary-income" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public salary and income page</a>, and just like he borrowed the idea from <b><a href="https://matthewsmith.website/salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Smith</a></b>, I also decided to "steal like an artist".
                </p>

                <p>
                    A little bit of extra context before jumping into numbers. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I skipped over the first few years as a professional working in <b>Portugal</b>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like many other Portuguese millennials that started their careers around the <b><time>2008</time> crisis</b>, I spent many years working as a "fake freelancer". Even though I had a boss and hierarchy, workplace, and working hours like any employee, I was being paid like a service provider and had to pay all taxes and social security (while illegal, this is still a common practice).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In <time>2014</time>, I moved to <b>Sweden</b>, where my career took off (or started to happen, depending on how you look at it). All numbers from then on are shown in <b>Swedish Krona</b> (SEK).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Keep in mind that in most European countries, salaries are paid monthly. Just multiply my values by 12 to get yearly figures ðŸ¤“
                </p>

                    <p>
                    All values displayed are income before taxes.

                    The <a href="http://www.swedishdesignsystems.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish Design Systems</a> has not gathered any sponsors, so it's only an expense at this point (time, domain name and Notion subscription).
                </p>

                <p>
                    My Product Design focused <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@menosketiago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>, is still far from reaching the minimum subscribers and watch time to enable monetization.

                    The <a href="https://figma.com/@menosketiago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma community assets</a> I have published so far have been almost 100% free.

                    <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/menosketiago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy me a coffee</a> donations have reached a whopping 15$ (no shade, I am thankful for my few oat milk latte patrons).

                        <h4>Graphic Designer â€” UI/UX Designer</h4>
                        <h5 class="money">â‚¬700/month on average</h5>

                        <p>
                            After a few years of unpaid internships and fake freelancing, I decided to skip the employers and become a real freelancer (just like Pinocchio became a real boy).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Being shy and lacking a good network meant a hard time finding clients that were both great to work with and paid well. But I managed to make ends meet, even though I never made more than <span class="money">â‚¬10 000</span> a year.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As a founding member at <b>WannaPlayer</b>, I worked for free for a few months until we secured a state-sponsored internship that landed me close to â‚¬700/month (my average from freelancing).

                        <h4>UI/UX Designer</h4>
                        <h5 class="money">24 000 SEK/month</h5>

                        <p>
                            My good friend <b>Hugo Campos</b> (from <b>WannaPlayer</b>) and I joined this super exciting startup, working on a WebGL engine and editor that allowed you to have games and interactive 3D experience running on any browser (very similar to <a href="https://spline.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spline</a>).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This salary meant a 3.4x increase from what I made back in Lisbon. In hindsight, it was a low salary by Swedish standards, but everyone there was trading money for working in something we felt passionate about and deeply believed in.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We even took a pay cut for a year to temporarily avoid layoffs and increase our runway while we tried to find product-market fit. Eventually, the money ran out, and <b>Amazon</b> bought the IP after we declared bankruptcy (for some years after, the product existed on AWS under the name <b>Sumerian</b>).

                    <time>2015 â€” 2017</time>

                        <h4>Senior Visual/Interaction Designer</h4>
                        <h5 class="money">32 500 SEK/month â†’ 40 000 SEK/month</h5>
                        <h5 class="money">30 000 SEK bonus</h5>

                        <p>
                            I was a full-time in-house consultant at Ericsson, one of the best know international Swedish brands (I even had a Sony Ericsson mobile one year prior).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It meant a decent salary jump but did not include paid time off, and the contract would end if the assignment concluded. I was employed by <b>SPLIT Stockholm</b>, but there was another agency in the middle called <b>Screen Interaction</b> (now <b>Daresay</b>). After the two agencies cut, my salary was far from what Ericsson paid for my work.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During my first assignment, I was found and poached by one of the main UX teams in the company. After learning that I was the only consultant on the team without paid time off, Didier (my manager at Ericsson) required that my consultant contract be adjusted accordingly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Due to our team's performance and a lot of evangelism on the value of design, Ericsson decided to switch from consultants to hiring only full-time designers. As I was under a non-compete clause, I needed to start thinking of my next job.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So to retain me until I finished my part on a mission-critical project (which led to the award-winning <a href="/work/ericsson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ericsson Design System</a>), I was offered a month's salary as an assignment completion bonus.

                        <p>
                            One of my consultant colleagues from <b>Ericsson</b> got word that I would be unemployed soon, so she referred me to her manager. Everything clicked, and I got a huge salary increase.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I spent two and a half years ensuring I worked to deserve the money. I implemented the <a href="/work/trioptima.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TriOptima Design System</a> both in Sketch and code, and even worked closely with the different product teams to create new features and improve the user experience for our customers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By 2019, I started feeling frustrated with the pace of product development and the lack of career growth opportunities. So it was time to find something new.

                        <p>
                            Did I mention I was feeling stuck career-wise?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I took a big pay cut because I was accepting a <b>Head of Design</b> role. The mission had a serious social impact, as the goal was to address the staff shortage in Swedish healthcare. Soon I learned that my employers thought I was coming in to maybe, eventually, if I deserved it, become their design executive.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To this day, I don't know if I mistakenly took a <span class="money">11 000 SEK</span> salary cut to do the same job I was doing before or if I misunderstood what we talked about during the interview process. I cannot fully dismiss the possibility of having heard what I wanted to hear (but gaslighting also leverages the ambiguity of individual memory).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here's what I know for sure. I wasn't ready to be a Design Leader and let my ambition and hubris get the best of me. A lesson learned the hard way ðŸ¤“

                        <p>
                            With my belly full of humble pie, I joined a great team of experienced individuals at <b>Stravito</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Even though my salary kept at the cut level, I worked my but off from day one. One week after starting, I got praised by the CEO during our town hall for helping to release the new website. During a hackathon, I prototyped a voice search feature that sales used to secure one of our largest customers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Then <b>COVID-19</b> happened, and because in Sweden, the last employees hired needed to be the first out in a layoff, I was again between jobs (a local euphemism for being unemployed).

                        <p>
                            I did not get any severance package (not required by law since I was on probation) or support, nor kept any of the stock options I had already worked towards.

                        <p>
                            When interviewing for <b>Mentimeter</b>, I got assigned a Frontend Developer take-home assignment by mistake. I don't normally do them as I think they are spec-work and do not provide much value for evaluating designers (there is no collaboration or stakeholder management, which, IMO are the core skills you need to look for).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The assignment was to create a <b>React</b>-based modular component as part of a hypothetical Design System, and I felt like even if I did not get the job, I would spend a week improving my code chops. I wrapped the assignment, sent it in, and waited for the eventual thanks for doing it, but we are going forward with another candidate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, I got a video call scheduled from <b>Niklas</b>, one of the founders and then CPO. The dev team was impressed with my exercise but surprised/confused with a designer that also codes. I was asked if I wanted a Frontend role, but I refused in favor of remaining a Product Designer, even if I would make the occasional PR. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I could finally improve my User Research knowledge. And I continued my path to becoming a <b>Figma</b> ninja, creating the missing component library to complete the <b>Ragnar Design System</b>, allowing the design team to create mockups and prototypes quickly that could be tested with users, saving us development time when the ideas did not work as planned.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Close to my first work anniversary, there was a design leadership change. After a few hard months, I eventually accepted I wasn't part of the new design strategy and started looking for my next challenge.

                        <p>
                            At Klarna, I almost managed to recover my 2019 salary level. I got an official <b>Senior Product Designer</b> title and got my first full-time <b>Design System</b> role.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It's also good to let you know that this was my 4th attempt at getting hired at Klarna (on the three previous ones, I did not even score a Talent Acquisition interview). And the process took two entire months of interviewing, case study presentation, and even a take-home assignment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Then the <b>tech layoffs of 2021/22</b> finally caught up with us after an 85% drop in Klarna's valuation.
                        </p>

                            While I wasn't part of the layoff, the process, communication, and subsequent decisions increased the toxicity level of the culture and worsened work relationships.

                            By the end of summer 2022, I decided the resulting organization was at odds with my values and sense of ethics. I finally became too burned out from trying to do my job while dealing with conflicting stakeholder agendas.

                            It was a crazy year, but with my team goals achieved, I left with a sense of fulfilled duty ðŸ’ª

                            After two coffees with <a href="https://josephbertino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Bertino</a> and an engaging interview with the CPO, <b>Wanda</b>, I accepted an offer to join Transfer Galaxy and work with <b>Design Ops</b>, improve the <b>Design System</b> and help manage/coach a junior Designer (as a start).

                        <p>
                            Like in 2017, I jumped in, willing and keen to prove I deserved my new (and finally updated) salary. I worked on everything from implementing a design critique practice, adding components to the <b>Luna Design System</b>, evaluating and requiring new software for the team, and even designing the now available <b>Transfer Galaxy debit card</b>.

                        <p>
                            Just four months after I started, the entire Product department (which included the Design team) was laid off, marking my third time getting laid off in Sweden.
