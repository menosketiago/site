                    <h3>Some key context</h3>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            By the end of 2017, in a climate of turmoil due to less than optimal financial results and
                            significant layoffs, it was clear that <b>Ericsson</b> needed a facelift and a mindset shift to
                            avoid missing the new opportunities with the arrival of 5G.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To kickstart what was seen internally as a transformational journey, a new brand was
                            commissioned from <b>Stockholm Design Lab</b>. My team was involved as stakeholders, and we
                            codenamed the project <b>Brand TwoDotZero</b>.

                    <h3>Crafting a new typeface</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            One of my first tasks was to gather design requirements for a new custom Ericsson typeface meant
                            to be the first building block of the brand rebuild effort. We quickly picked a couple of basic
                            needs. One of our first consensuses was that it had to convey "swedishness", a mix of swiss
                            design with tech modernity that was well illustrated by <a
                                href="https://identity.sweden.se/buildingblocks/secondary-building-blocks-always-use#our-main-typeface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sweden Sans</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From a technical standpoint, we were very adamant about having features like a monospace option,
                            slashed zeros (to differentiate "o" from "0" easily), and tabular numerals (so that you can
                            compare number greatness visually and for data visualization purposes). After plenty of ideation
                            and iterations, <a href="https://lettersfromsweden.se/ericsson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letters from Sweden</a> delivered <b>Hilda Sans</b>, an homage to Lars Magnus
                            Ericsson's wife.

                    <h3>A User Experience first brand</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            If we wanted the new brand to have a real transformational and galvanizing effect, we needed to
                            flip the Ericsson rule book around. We focused on creating design (not designer) principles that
                            would be at the core of everything the company did to move forward into the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, three brand principles were adopted as mantras that everyone could mentally recite.
                            <b>Focused simplicity</b>, <b>delight means performance</b>, and <b>coherence inside out</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Based on these, we generated specific UX principles to guide designers and developers. I called
                            this the <b>Ericsson UX 2.0</b> vision and presented it during the <b>Ericsson Leadership Summit
                                2017</b>, an event that packed Globen with the top worldwide managers.

                            We should make things as simple as possible, removing unnecessary details and decoration, which
                            might get in the way of the experience.

                            Light and shadow are two important building blocks of reality and play a big role in the way we
                            experience the world. The closer a layer is to the user, the lighter it gets. Layering is also a
                            great way to convey hierarchy, clarifying the order of triggered events and other interface
                            changes.

                <h3>Applying our design principles</h3>

                    <p>
                        Principles like the word (from the Latin word <i>principium</i>) are only the beginning,
                        and they have to be tested and applied so that you can know their mettle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the weeks that followed their approval and socialization, my entire team came together to bring 
                        one of the products we were responsible for, into this new vision and design language.

                        <p>
                            To better explain and get buy-in from management for the layers concept, I created a quick and dirty
                            prototype using <b>Principle</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This enabled us to move the conversation from vision to practice,
                            as some stakeholders did not fully grasp the concept until they saw it as moving pixels.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            With everyone on board with the majority of the new concepts, it was time to start refining the
                            actual UI elements. It was also the perfect timing to transition from <b>Adobe Illustrator</b>,
                            which was until then the official tool for mockups, towards <b>Sketch</b>, a much better tool
                            for interface design that came with shared design libraries as much needed addition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other benefit was a tight integration with Principle, which made creating higher fidelity
                            prototypes a breeze.

                    <h4>Creating an end-to-end user flow</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The last step before the big reveal on the leadership summit, was to lift an end-to end flow
                            from the <b>Ericsson Security Manager</b> (a product being designed in our team) and translate
                            it into the new design language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To achieve it, we created pixel-perfect mockups for all the screens and animated every little
                            interaction in <b>After Effects</b>. Doing so allowed us, in the short time we had until the
                            brand reveal, to produce a video that looked like a real functioning product would eventually
                            look like after implemented.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        As a consultant, your stay on a company is always on a time limit, and by the Summer of 2017,
                        Ericsson decided to start building up their in-house design team, to better prepare for a more
                        design driven future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the end of the year, the <b>Ericsson Design System</b> that grew from my team's experience
                        creating the tech stack agnostic <b>Loki</b> CSS/JS framework and the UX vision work we did for
                        the new brand, was awarded a <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2018/8/ericsson-wins-red-dot-awards-for-brand-and-interface-design"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Dot Design Award</a> and an <a

                            rel="noopener">IF Design Award</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the years after, the work we did was the foundation from which a team of 6 people with 4
                        consultants, grew to a multifunctional research, design, and engineering team with over
                        30 people (2 short of the total count of designers in the company during my tenure) that 
                        are trusted to prototype and kickstart the most innovative initiatives at Ericsson.
