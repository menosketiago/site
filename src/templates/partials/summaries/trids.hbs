                A story of how a small team of designers with almost no
                development resources created a thriving design system used on
                products that have helped compress thousands of trillions of
                dollars in gross notional in the OTC financial market.
            </p>
            <p>
                Or how one motivated designer created 2 Sketch libraries and
                implemented and maintained a tech stack agnostic CSS/JS
                framework used in 5 products, where one critical bug could spell
                thousands of dollars in losses.
