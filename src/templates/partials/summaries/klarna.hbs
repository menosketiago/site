      <h3>Klarna Website Design System</h3>

      <p>
        Can a Design System make it as
        <i>smoooth</i>
        to design, implement, and maintain 37+ multi-language websites (as well
        as dozens of bespoke campaign pages per year) as it is to buy with
        <b>Klarna</b>? How about providing full support for multiple brands and
        sub-brands?
      </p>
      <p>
        Find out how a small team of Klarnauts achieved all of this and much
        more in under a year.
