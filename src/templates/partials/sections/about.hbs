        <h2>About —</h2>

        <p>
            I was born in <b>1984</b> in <b>Lisbon</b>, <b>Portugal</b>. At 16, I started freelancing as a <b>Digital Colorist</b> which lead to discovering illustration as one of my passions. And in <b>2008</b> I completed my <b>Master’s in Product Design</b> at <b>Lisbon’s Fine Arts School</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of my beliefs is that a designer’s job is to bridge user needs with business and development. Therefore, designers should conduct just enough <b>research</b>, visualize with <b>wireframes</b> or <b>mockups</b>, and <b>prototype</b> as soon as possible to enable stakeholder/development alignment and, just in time <b>usability testing</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also advocate that designers should learn to <b>code</b> (I’m a nerd for <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JS</b>), and that no company is too small to have a <b>Design System</b> (I’ve been a contributor in 5 in the last few years).
